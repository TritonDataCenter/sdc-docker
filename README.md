# sdc-docker

A Docker Engine for SmartDataCenter, where the data center is exposed
as a single Docker host. The Docker remote API is served from a "docker" core
SDC zone built from this repo.


# User Guide

For users of the beta service in Joyent's public cloud, or those using
an SDC Docker stand up, but not administering it, please see the
[User Guide](./docs/index.md).  The rest of this README is targetted at
*development* of sdc-docker.


# Current State

Many commands are currently at least partially implemented. See
[docs/divergence.md](./docs/divergence.md) for details on where sdc-docker
diverges from Docker Inc's docker.  While Joyent has deployed this into early
access, this software is still under active development and should be used in
production with care.


# Installation

Note: Examples in this section are for
[CoaL](https://github.com/joyent/sdc#cloud-on-a-laptop-coal). However the
only thing CoaL-specific is the IP for the headnode (root@10.99.99.7).
For example, you could do the same on Joyent Engineering's internal
"nightly-1" DC with "root@172.26.1.4".

1. Installing sdc-docker and supporting services:

        ssh root@10.99.99.7                                 # ssh to the CoaL GZ
        sdcadm self-update
        sdcadm post-setup common-external-nics && sleep 10  # imgapi needs external
        sdcadm post-setup dev-headnode-prov
        sdcadm post-setup dev-sample-data  # sample packages for docker containers
        sdcadm post-setup cloudapi
        sdcadm experimental update-docker
        # Optional additional steps for VXLAN setup.
        sdcadm experimental portolan
        sdcadm experimental fabrics --coal
        #  <reboot>
        sapiadm update $(sdc-sapi /services?name=docker | json -Ha uuid) metadata.USE_FABRICS=true


SDC Docker uses (as of [DOCKER-312](https://smartos.org/bugview/DOCKER-312))
TLS by default. That means you need to setup a user (or use the 'admin' user)
and add an SSH key for access.

2. Create a test user (we'll use "jill"):

        # On your dev machine, create a key
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/sdc-docker-jill.id_rsa -b 2048 -N ""

        # Copy it to COAL so we can add it to the 'jill' account.
        scp ~/.ssh/sdc-docker-jill.id_rsa.pub root@10.99.99.7:/var/tmp/

        ssh root@10.99.99.7      # ssh to the CoaL GZ
        sdc-useradm create -A login=jill email=jill@localhost userpassword=secret123
        sdc-useradm add-key jill /var/tmp/sdc-docker-jill.id_rsa.pub

3. Generate a client TLS certificate and set `docker` to use `--tls` mode:

    This script in the sdc-docker repo will create the client certificate
    and print how to configure `docker`:

        ./tools/sdc-docker-setup.sh coal jill ~/.ssh/sdc-docker-jill.id_rsa

    This also puts the env setup in "~/.sdc/docker/jill/env.sh".

        source ~/.sdc/docker/jill/env.sh

You should now able to get `docker info` and see "SDCAccount: jill":

    $ docker info
    Containers: 0
    Images: 0
    Storage Driver: sdc
     SDCAccount: jill
    Execution Driver: sdc-0.1.0
    Operating System: SmartDataCenter
    Name: coal

# Using custom TLS server certificates for SDC Docker

SDC Docker can optionally be setup to use your own TLS certificates. By
default, the Docker VM is provisioned with a self-signed certificate
that can always be overridden with the following commands:

        # Copy your TLS certificate to the SDC headnode (assuming COAL)
        scp ./my-key.pem root@10.99.99.7:/var/tmp/
        scp ./my-cert.pem root@10.99.99.7:/var/tmp/

        # Install the TLS certificate
        sdcadm experimental install-docker-cert -k /var/tmp/my-key.pem -c /var/tmp/my-cert.pem

This command will automatically restart the SDC Docker service so certificate
changes will take effect immediately. After changing the TLS certificates, you
will need to re-run the ./tools/sdc-docker-setup.sh script.

# Running SDC docker in invite-only mode

The public APIs to an SDC -- sdc-docker and cloudapi -- can be configured to
be in invite-only mode where only explicitly allowed accounts are given
authorized. This mode is configured via the `account_allowed_dcs`
[SDC Application config var](https://github.com/joyent/sdc/blob/master/docs/operator-guide/configuration.md#sdc-application-configuration).

    sdc-sapi /applications/$(sdc-sapi /applications?name=sdc | json -H 0.uuid) \
        -X PUT -d '{"metadata": {"account_allowed_dcs": true}}'
    # Optional "403 Forbidden" response body.
    sdc-sapi /applications/$(sdc-sapi /applications?name=sdc | json -H 0.uuid) \
        -X PUT -d '{"metadata": {"account_allowed_dcs_msg": "talk to your Administrator"}}'

Once enabled, one can allow an account via:

    DC=$(sh /lib/sdc/config.sh -json | json datacenter_name)
    sdc-useradm add-attr LOGIN allowed_dcs $DC

and an account access removed via:

    sdc-useradm delete-attr LOGIN allowed_dcs $DC

Allowed users can be listed via:

    sdc-useradm search allowed_dcs=$DC -o uuid,login,email,allowed_dcs

For example:

    [root@headnode (coal) ~]# sdc-useradm add-attr admin allowed_dcs coal
    Added attribute on user 930896af-bf8c-48d4-885c-6573a94b1853 (admin): allowed_dcs=coal

    [root@headnode (coal) ~]# sdc-useradm search allowed_dcs=coal -o uuid,login,email,allowed_dcs
    UUID                                  LOGIN  EMAIL           ALLOWED_DCS
    930896af-bf8c-48d4-885c-6573a94b1853  admin  root@localhost  ["us-west-2","coal"]

    [root@headnode (coal) ~]# sdc-useradm delete-attr admin allowed_dcs coal
    Deleted attribute "allowed_dcs=coal" from user 930896af-bf8c-48d4-885c-6573a94b1853 (admin)

Limitation: Currently adding access can take a minute or two to take effect
(caching) and removing access **requires the sdc-docker server to be
restarted (DOCKER-233).**


# Adding packages

By default the size of the container (ram, disk, cpu shares) uses the package in
the internal "sdc_" set of packages closest to 'ram=1024 MiB'. The "sdc_"
packages are really only applicable for development. More appropriate for
production is a set of packages separate from "sdc_". The following can be
run to add a number of "t4-*" packages and to configure the Docker service
to use them:

    sdc-login docker /opt/smartdc/docker/tools/gen_packages.js
    /opt/smartdc/bin/sapiadm update \
       $(/opt/smartdc/bin/sdc-sapi /services?name=docker | json -H 0.uuid) \
       metadata.PACKAGE_PREFIX="t4-"



# Development hooks

Before commiting be sure to:

    make check      # lint and style checks
    make test       # run unit tests

A good way to do that is to install the stock pre-commit hook in your
clone via:

    make git-hooks


# Testing

As shown above, the run unit tests locally:

    make test

To run *integration* tests, you need to call the "test/runtests" driver from
the *global zone* (GZ) of a SmartDataCenter setup with sdc-docker,
e.g. with COAL that would be:

    ssh root@10.99.99.7
    /zones/$(vmadm lookup -1 alias=docker0)/root/opt/smartdc/docker/test/runtests

specifically for COAL there is a target for that:

    make test-integration-in-coal

To run (a) a particular subset of integration tests -- using 'info' as a filter
on test names in this example -- and (b) with trace-level logging:

    LOG_LEVEL=trace /zones/$(vmadm lookup -1 alias=docker0)/root/opt/smartdc/docker/test/runtests -f info 2>&1 | bunyan

Some integration tests (those that don't depend on running in the GZ) can be
run from your Mac dev tree, e.g.:

    ./test/runtest ./test/integration/info.test.js


# Official docker test suite

Docker have their own test suite *integration-cli* for testing a real docker
environment. To run the docker cli tests against coal, you will need a local
docker binary and go (golang) installed, then do the following:

    # Target coal
    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://my.docker.coal:2376
    export DOCKER_TEST_HOST=$DOCKER_HOST

    # Set go path, so `go get` works correctly
    mkdir go && cd go
    export GOPATH=`pwd`

    # Checkout docker from git
    mkdir -p src/github.com/docker
    cd src/github.com/docker
    git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git
    cd docker

    # Build docker test infrastructure.
    sh hack/make/.go-autogen   # docker automated build files
    # If `go get` shows an error - just ignore it.
    go get ./...               # docker dependencies

    cd integration-cli

    # Run an individual test
    go test -test.run "^TestPsListContainers"

    # Run all tests - this will take forever... a specific test will be faster.
    go test -v


# Development from your Mac

1. Add a 'coal' entry to your '~/.ssh/config'. Not required, but we'll use this
   as a shortcut in examples below.

        Host coal
            User root
            Hostname 10.99.99.7
            ForwardAgent yes
            StrictHostKeyChecking no
            UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
            ControlMaster no

2. Get a clone on your Mac:

        git clone git@github.com:joyent/sdc-docker.git
        cd sdc-docker

3. Make changes in your local clone:

        vi

4. Sync your changes to your 'docker0' zone in COAL (see
   [Installation](#installation) above):

        ./tools/rsync-to coal

   This will rsync over changes (excepting binary bits like a change in
   sdcnode version, or added binary node modules) and restart the docker
   SMF service.


For testing I tend to have a shell open tailing the docker service's log file:

    ssh coal
    sdc-login docker
    tail -f `svcs -L docker` | bunyan


# Coding style

You've gotta have one to put to rest some of the bikeshedding. Here's the one
for this repo:

- 4-space indentation

- `camelCase` capitalization for variables. This is within reason -- exceptions
  where case is required due to outside APIs (e.g. Docker APIs) is fine.

- `ClassCase` for classes (i.e. JS prototype'd functions).

- Imports from "lib/models" shall consistently be imported as follows to allow
  grepping for "Link.list", etc.

        var ImageTag = require('.../models/image-tag');
        var Link = require('.../models/link');
