## Divergence

The SDC Docker implementation does not support third-party registries at this time. Follow [DOCKER-380](https://smartos.org/bugview/DOCKER-380) for progress updates.

Self-hosted private repos that use self-signed certificates are not supported. Follow [DOCKER-382](https://smartos.org/bugview/DOCKER-382) for progress updates. See also [Private repositories](../features/repos.md).

Please contact Joyent support or file a ticket if you discover any additional divergence.
