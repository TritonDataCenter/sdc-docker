# Divergence

Joyent's implementation of the Docker Remote API has some added features as well as omissions where the API conflicted with the needs of deploying containers across Triton data centers.

## Features

- [CPU and memory resource allocation](features/resources.md)
- [Overlay networks](features/networks.md)
- [Volumes](features/volumes.md)
- [Private registries](features/repos.md)

## Container behavior and contents

### Extra Processes

#### zsched

In containers you may see a `zsched` process in addition to your other
processes. It owns the kernel threads that do work on behalf of your zone.
The PID of this process should always show up as 0, though some versions of
`ps` on Linux filter this out.

#### ipmgmtd

If you don't have `docker:noipmgmtd` set in your internal_metadata, you will
have an additional process `ipmgmtd`. This is the SmartOS daemon that manages
network interfaces and TCP/IP tunables. The default if you use sdc-docker is
that docker:noipmgmtd will be true when you're provisioning a regular LX docker
container, and false if you're provisioning a SmartOS container.

### Extra Files

#### /var/log/sdc-dockerinit.log

This is the log from the dockerinit process which sets up the container for
your initial process and then exec()s it. This log exists only for debugging
problems with the way the initial process has been setup.

### Extra Filesystems

#### /native/*

If you run `mount` or `df` you will see several filesystems mounted in from
/native. These are bits from the SmartOS host mounted in to support the LX
emulation.

#### objfs on /system/object

This is the SmartOS kernel object filesystem. The contents of the filesystem
are dynamic and reflect the current state of the system. See:

http://illumos.org/man/7fs/objfs

for more information.

#### ctfs on /system/contract

This is the SmartOS contract file system which is the interface to the SmartOS
contract subsystem.

See:

http://illumos.org/man/4/contract

for more information.

### Exit Statuses

When a container exits the exit status as returned by sdc-docker will currently
be different from that which would be returned by Docker Inc's docker. This is
due to differences in the way we handle processes within zones. This is
currently considered to be a deficiency and should be improved by [DOCKER-41](http://smartos.org/bugview/DOCKER-41).

## Performance of container management functions

Actions performed against sdc-docker are slower, and sometimes _much_ slower
than those same actions performed against a local docker. This is something we
are working on, and intend to keep improving over time.

## Docker Remote API methods and Docker CLI commands

In most cases Joyent has taken great efforts to be [bug for bug compatible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_compatibility) with Docker Inc's API implementation (see [restart policies](./features/restart.md)). Please see documentation for [specific methods](./commands/) for any known divergence and file bugs as needed.

SDC Docker implements all the API methods necessary to build and deploy Docker
containers in the cloud, though there are some missing docker API methods.
Here's the list of API methods currently unimplemented as of this writing, but
expect it to get shorter by the day:

`docker diff`, `docker events`, `docker export`, `docker import`, `docker load`,
`docker network`, `docker node`, `docker pause`, `docker save`,
`docker service`, `docker swarm`, `docker unpause`, `docker update`

### Roadmap:
- `docker network` is on our near-term roadmap, follow
[DOCKER-722](http://smartos.org/bugview/DOCKER-722), [DOCKER-723](http://smartos.org/bugview/DOCKER-723),
[DOCKER-724](http://smartos.org/bugview/DOCKER-724), [DOCKER-725](http://smartos.org/bugview/DOCKER-725)
  for updates.
- `docker events` will not be implemented in the near future. This causes a
  trivial error when attempting to watch logs with `docker-compose`. Users who
  intend to use `docker events` for container orchestration purposes should
  look at [ContainerPilot](https://www.joyent.com/containerpilot)â€™s automatic
  service registration, health checking, and configuration.
- There is no plan to implement `docker node` and `docker swarm` as Triton is
  already working as a horizontally scalable cluster. There is no need for a
  set of compute node orchestration commands.

## Images and private registries

SDC Docker supports the integration with Docker Hub and third party registries through
Docker's Registry v2 API (the deprecated v1 API is not supported).

### Container Logging

SDC Docker implements most of the log driver functionality as described in
[Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/logging/overview/).
The differences in behavior when using these drivers are documented in the [Log
Drivers feature page](./features/logdrivers.md).

In addition to the divergence in the use of these drivers, SDC Docker handles
logging differently than Docker. With Docker, logs are only written to the host
when the log driver is set to 'json-file'. With SDC Docker the logs are written
to the host for every log driver except 'none'. These logs are captured because
while the network-based log drivers are good for real-time log analysis, they
can potentially lose messages due to conditions like remote host unavailablity
and race conditions in startup/shutdown. The host logs are written to local
storage by the zoneadmd process that manages the zone and therefore avoids these
problems.

The storage for these log files will be within a container's quota but not
visible from within the container itself. Operators will see these logs at
/zones/:uuid/logs/stdio.log*. These will be rotated to another file in the same
directory with a timestamp extension when they reach a max-size value. The
max-size can be specified when using the json-file log driver. Otherwise the
default (currently defaults to 50M) is set in the SDC configuration. This can
be adjusted by an operator through the DEFAULT_MAX_LOG_SIZE property in the
docker service's SAPI metadata.

For the user of SDC Docker, this additional log when using a log driver other
than json-file is not of much use yet, but are important to know about as they
do use space from the user's container. In the future, these logs will be
automatically consumed and uploaded to Manta which will free this space and give
users access to all their logs.

For the operator of SDC Docker these additional logs will require some cleanup
process for long-lived containers when Manta support is not available.


## Container Labels

Triton uses (and reserves) a number of custom container labels, to provide
specific Triton features. These are:

The `triton.*` namespace is reserved for Triton specific use cases, these label
names are currently defined:

* `triton.cns.disable` (boolean): Can be set on a container to tell the CNS
  service to not serve records for this instance.
* `triton.cns.services` (string): Comma-separated list of DNS-name strings
  for the CNS service.
* `triton.cns.reverse_ptr` (string): DNS reverse pointer for this container.
  Used by the CNS service.
* `triton.network.public` (string): Set on a container, used to specify the
  external network name the instance will use.

The `com.joyent.*` namespace is reserved for Joyent/Triton specific use cases,
these label names are currently defined:

* `com.joyent.package` (string): Set on a container, used to choose a specific
  package for the container. The value can be a package name like
  `g4-standard-1G`, a UUID, or the first 8 characters of a UUID
  (short-UUID).


## Other Differences

SDC Docker supports certain versions of Docker CLI and Compose clients. Check
the [supported versions](../#docker-version) and the individual command
references to see which command options can be used with SDC Docker.
