      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.


* Additional copyright may be retained by contributors other
  than Joyent, the sdc-docker developers, or the parties
  enumerated in this file. Such copyright can be determined
  on a case-by-case basis by examining the author of each
  portion of a file in the revision-control commit records
  of the project, or by consulting representative comments
  claiming copyright ownership for a file.

  In all such cases, the absence of explicit licensing text
  indicates that the contributor chose to license their work
  for distribution under identical terms to those Joyent
  has chosen for the collective work, enumerated at the top
  of this file. The only difference is the retention of
  copyright itself, held by the contributor.
