# Docker on SmartDataCenter User Guide

Welcome to Docker on SmarDataCenter. The Docker Engine for SDC is currently in
alpha and under heavy development. The current focus is stabilization and
filling out support for *running* Docker containers.

This document is meant as a user guide for those getting started using a Docker
on SmartDataCenter service, e.g. the beta service in Joyent's public cloud
(details below). If you are interested in running or developing
the Docker Engine for SDC, see the [sdc-docker README](https://github.com/joyent/sdc-docker/blob/master/README.md).

The Docker Engine for SmartDataCenter treats the entire data center as
a single Docker host. Each container is a SmartOS LX-branded zone. Benefits:

- [Zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Containers) have a
  proven security track record for isolation.
- LX-branded zones provide the abilty to run Linux binaries in SmartOS
  zones, meaning you can use Docker images without modification *and*
  without the overhead of hardware-based virtualization.
- [Overlay network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network)
  support (VXLAN) means you have a private network between all your containers,
  across servers.

And the full stack is open source: [sdc-docker](https://github.com/joyent/sdc-docker),
[SmartDataCenter](https://github.com/joyent/sdc),
and [SmartOS](https://github.com/joyent/smartos-live).


**A note for users of Joyent's public cloud:** Joyent is hosting a beta of
their Docker service. Please sign up at https://www.joyent.com/lp/preview and
read on for the settings for the standard Docker client.


## Current Status

The Docker Engine for SDC is currently in alpha and under heavy development.
The current focus is on stabilization and filling out support for *running*
Docker containers. Support for building images (`docker build`) is forthcoming.
Please [report issues](https://github.com/joyent/sdc-docker/issues),
give us feedback or discuss on [#joyent IRC on freenode.net](irc://freenode.net/#joyent).

# Getting Started

*This section will use the current Joyent public cloud Docker beta for examples.
Note that the same instructions hold for any sdc-docker standup.*

The Docker Engine for SDC is all about using the `docker` CLI. So all that is
required is to set up an account with a SmartDataCenter cloud and to configure
your environment variables for the `docker` client.

1. Install `docker`.
2. Setup an account with the SmartDataCenter, in this case
   the [Joyent Public Cloud](https://my.joyent.com).
3. Run the 'sdc-docker-setup.sh' script to set the env.


## 1. Install `docker`

If you have docker version 1.4.1 or higher then you can move on to the next
step. *Note: The minimum docker client version might be raised to 1.5.0.*

    $ docker --version
    Docker version 1.4.1, build 5bc2ff8

Otherwise, please follow [Docker's own installation
instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation).
Unfortunately, it's not Docker does not yet have a standalone client
(i.e. you have to also install the Docker Engine, a.k.a. daemon, on
your computer).


## 2. Set Up an SDC Account

The SmartDataCenter CLI environment is not necessary for to use Docker on SDC,
but for beta testing it will be helpful. To test that your
SmartDataCenter client environment is configured, you can run `sdc-getaccount`:

    $ sdc-getaccount
    {
      "id": "....387c",
      "login": "jill",
      "email": "jill@example.com",
      "companyName": "Acme",
      "firstName": "Jill",
      ...
    }

If sdc-getaccount works, then move on to [the next step](#3-sdc-docker-setup).
Otherwise:

1. [Create](https://my.joyent.com/landing/signup/) or [sign in](https://my.joyent.com)
   to your Joyent Cloud account,
2. [Add an SSH public key to your account.](https://my.joyent.com/main/#!/account)
   and,
3. Install [SDC CLI](https://apidocs.joyent.com/cloudapi/#getting-started) and
   configure the SDC env.

If you have one, use your existing SSH public key. If you don't have a key pair,
 you can create a new one via something like:

    # Create an SSH public/private key pair of type "RSA", with no passphrase
    # (you can add a passphrase if you like, drop the '-P ""').
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "my-sdc-docker-key" -P "" -f ~/.ssh/sdc-docker.id_rsa

This will create:

    ~/.ssh/sdc-docker.id_rsa      # your private key file
    ~/.ssh/sdc-docker.id_rsa.pub  # your public key file

It is the *public* key, the ending .pub, that you want to upload via the
"Import Public Key" button on [your account page](https://my.joyent.com/main/#!/account).

For more details on account setup and adding an SSH key, see [the Joyent
Cloud Getting Started documentation](https://docs.joyent.com/jpc/getting-started-with-your-joyent-cloud-account).

You can now set up the SDC command line tools (called node-smartdc). See the
[CloudAPI Getting Started documentation](https://apidocs.joyent.com/cloudapi/#getting-started).

(For those using an SDC Docker standup other than the Joyent public cloud,
see the [User Management](https://docs.joyent.com/sdc7/user-management) operator
guide docs.)


## 3. sdc-docker-setup.sh

Now that you have access to a SmartDataCenter, we will set up authentication
to the Docker host. SDC Docker uses Docker's TLS authentication. This section
will show you how to create a TLS client certificate from the SSH key you
created in the previous section. Then we'll configure `docker` to send that
client certificate to identify requests as coming from you.

Follow the steps in [the API guide to get connected and start using SDC Docker](../api/README.md).

- where to go if hit troubles
